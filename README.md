# Achilles-Orbit
Achilles is a large Jupiter trojan asteroid that is stuck in Jupiter's orbit for millions of years.

In this repo, I used [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) to get time and coordinates and solar system dynamics data, [Polyastro](https://docs.poliastro.space/en/stable/) to simulate (in 2D) the orbits of the sun, earth, moon and Achilles as plots, get their distances.
